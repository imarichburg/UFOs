# UFOs
UFO sightings website using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap

### Overview of Project: 
I created a website to allow user to view UFO sightings data in table format by filtering which date, location, or siting type they are interested in.

### Results: 

I was provided with a JavaScript file entitled "data.js" containing a dictionary of UFO Sightings data.

I was tasked with creating a Website that could be used to search through the data using different filters.  I added 5 filters: Date, City, State, Country, and Shape to match the data display table. A function is used to only display table data that matches the user input.

The main page of the UFO sightings website has 5 filters located at the bottom left. When the user clicks away from the filter box, the function will only display data that matches the user input. The user can enter multiple filters to display data that matches all entered filters.



### Summary: 

The website asthetically pleasing, professional looking and functionalis but does have some drawbacks.  

1. The website is limited to UFO sighting data provided in the JavaScript Dictionary that was provided. A reccomended improvement would be to use a larger database for UFO sightings.  The website could also be able to take in UFO sightings.

2. The user input must be entered the way it is modedled in the default setting.  Dates must be entered the way dates are written in the United States, MM/DD/YYYY.  City and Stat must be entered using lower case but Country must be entered in capitol letters. Some changes to the function to be made so that the filters are not case sensitive and could accept dates in other formats.

3. Currently the user must know the types of shapes for UFO sightings.  It would be better to use radio buttons or a drop down menu for "shape" so that the user could choose for options for UFO sighting shapes.
